# Project 0a : Degree <br/>
### Before visiting the projects, please carefully read about [CS50 Academic Honesty] <br/>
- The first project makes use of the breadth-first search technique to determine the "degrees of separation" between two actors, commonly known as the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon." <br/>
- Link to full assignment descriptions on Harvard website : [Degree ](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/degrees/ "Degree ") <br/>
- Due to the limitation on file sizes allowed by Github to be uploaded to Github, I only uploaded "small" movie datasets to Github. <br/>
- To execute the python script, type the following command in a bash terminal <br/>

```bash
python degrees.py small
```
