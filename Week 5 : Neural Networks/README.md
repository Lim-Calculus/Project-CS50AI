## Project 5: Traffic <br/>
- This project is to develop a rudimentary computer vision neural network that recognizes traffic signs in preparation for automated driving. <br/>
- Download the [data set](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) (gtsrb) for this project and unzip it. Move the resulting gtsrb directory inside of your traffic directory. <br/>
